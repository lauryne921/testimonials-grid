# testimonials-grid

I liked to do this work with HTML and CSS, it wasn't very difficult so I hope it's very good. 

I think it's the first time I well done the responsive, let me know what you think about it. 

I started by creating some div
Then I created the display: grid; 

I added all the grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row-start and grid-row-end. 

And then I started to add style to the different div so padding, margin, background-color etc 

And when I finished the desktop version, I started to the responsive.
